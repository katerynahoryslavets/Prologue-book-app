You want to create a mobile app for tracking reading habits, finding books via an API, creating a wishlist, and viewing book reviews. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A central screen displaying current reading progress, recently finished books, and recommendations.\n-   **Book Search:** Integrate with a book API (e.g., Google Books API) to allow users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN. Display search results with book covers and basic information.\n-   **Wishlist:** A dedicated screen where users can add books they want to read in the future.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\nLet's go with a light theme for now.\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    -   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#6E7191` (Grayish Blue)\n    -   Primary: `#645CAA` (Medium Purple)\n    -   Secondary: `#A084DC` (Light Purple)\n    -   Accent: `#D0B8A8` (Light Brown)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    -   Highlight: `#BDB2FF` (Lavender)\n-   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Implement Book Search:**\n    *   Modify the `HomeScreen` (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`) to include a search bar.\n    *   When the user searches, call a book API (you'll need to choose one and handle API keys). For now, let's mock the API call with some hardcoded data.\n    *   Display the search results in a list format on the `HomeScreen`.\n2.  **Create Wishlist Screen:**\n    *   Create a new screen called `WishlistScreen` (`app/(tabs)/wishlist.tsx`).\n    *   Add a button to the `HomeScreen` to navigate to the `WishlistScreen`.\n    *   For now, the `WishlistScreen` will just display a static list of books.\n3.  **Add Books to Wishlist:**\n    *   Add a button to each book item in the search results on the `HomeScreen` to add it to the wishlist.\n    *   When the user presses the button, store the book in a local state (for now).\n    *   Update the `WishlistScreen` to display the books stored in the local state.\n4.  **Remove modalDemos array:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-13T16:06:58.738413"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a reading tracker app with book search, wishlist functionality, and reviews.
